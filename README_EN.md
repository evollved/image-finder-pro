## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Backup Recommendation
**Always backup your files and database before deleting any images.** While the module includes safety checks, accidental deletion is possible.

### Performance Considerations
- Large catalogs (10,000+ images) may take several minutes to scan
- Enable recursive search only when necessary
- Adjust max files limit based on your server capabilities

### Security
- Module requires administrator permissions
- Only users with modify permissions can delete files
- Files are validated before deletion

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No unused images found" but I know there are some**
- Check if recursive search is enabled
- Verify the images are in `/image/catalog/` directory
- Ensure file extensions are supported (jpg, png, gif, webp)

**"Error deleting file" messages**
- Check file permissions in the image directory
- Verify files aren't locked by other processes
- Ensure files exist at the specified paths

**Module not appearing in admin**
- Clear OpenCart modification cache
- Check if OCMod modifications are enabled
- Verify XML installation was successful
